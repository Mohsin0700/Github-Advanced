                    write git add . it will add all the files in the directory
                    otherwise we can add an individual file by writing git add

                    staging area</p>

        <h2>Branches in Git</h2>
        <h3>Definition:</h3>
        <p>Whenever two or more developers work on the same project they can
            create multiple branches. Creating branch means everyone is creating
            their own copy of the project of that poin from where branch is
            created.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>git branch</h3>
                <p>This command is used to see all available branches</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>git branch -M "Branch Name"</h3>
                <p>This command is used to change the name of the current
                    branch</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>git checkout -b "Branch Name"</h3>
                <p>This command is used to create a new
                    branch, when we create a new branch by default we navigate
                    to that branch</p>
                <b>Note: When we create a new branch it means we are creating a
                    copy of the project from the that point when branch is
                    created</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>git checkout "Branch Name"</h3>
                <p>This command is used to navigate to a particular branch</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>git branch -d "Branch Name"</h3>
                <p>This command is used to delete the branch locally and keep
                    working tree clean. We often use this branch once the
                    feature on which we were working is merged to the main
                    branch. It helps to clean the working tree</p>
                <p><b>Note: We can't delete the main branch and to delete a
                        branch first we must move from that branch</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>git push origin --delete "Branch Name"</h3>
                <p>This command is used to delete the branch from github</p>
            </li>
